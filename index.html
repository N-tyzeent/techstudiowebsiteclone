            <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.</p>
            <p>Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.</p>

           <h3>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
           <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the necessary free software.

            At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language experience is required.</p>
