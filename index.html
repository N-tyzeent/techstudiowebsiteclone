            <h3>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h3>
            <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.

              The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.</p>
            
            <h3>What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?</h3>
            <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.</p>
            <p>You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development – managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale.</p>

           <h3>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
           <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you through installing the necessary free software.

            At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language experience is required.</p>
